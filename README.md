FFXI Windower addons

Disclaimer: AuctionHelper, Trade, TradeNPC SellNPC and NPCit inject packet to the ffxi server and have a potential risk of getting you banned. Most of these addons pose nominal risks that everyday windower users are exposed to by addons such as gearswap or autojoin and as such should not get you banned. However some features such as selling all items instantly(NPCit), is something the client cannot do natively and would have a greater chance of action taken against your account.
